      For the past 4 years, I've been a software developer who also enjoys
      designing user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX). I've had the
      chance to work on over 30 projects, from large-scale ones like customer
      relationship management (CRM) systems, e-commerce platforms, and delivery
      apps, to smaller projects that helped me hone my skills. My main goal is
      to become a true expert in the field of software development
