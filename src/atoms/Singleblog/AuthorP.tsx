        For the past 4 years, I've been a software developer who also enjoys
        designing user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX). I've had the
        chance to work on over 30 projects, from large-scale ones like customer
        relationship management (CRM) systems, e-commerce platforms, and
        delivery apps, to smaller projects that helped me hone my skills. My
        main goal is to become a true expert in the field of software
        development
